# 👋 Hi, I'm David

I am a developer building tools to make mobile game development easier.

### 🚀 My current project: [ShipThis CLI](https://github.com/shipth-is/cli)

**ShipThis** is a command-line tool to build and upload Godot games to the App Store and Google Play - no Xcode or Android Studio required. Publish your Godot game to iOS & Android in minutes - no keystores, provisioning profiles, or headaches.

```bash
shipthis game ship
```

- ✅ Always a free tier — enough build minutes for most solo devs  
- ✨ One-command setup with an interactive `wizard`  
- ⏩ No additional build tools to install
- 🔐 Handles signing, certificates, keystores, and API keys  
- 🚀 One-command publishing to TestFlight or Google Play

⭐ Star the repo if you find it helpful - it means a lot!
