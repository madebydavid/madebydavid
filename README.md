# Hi, I'm David

I am a developer building tools to make mobile game development easier.

### My current project: [ShipThis CLI](https://github.com/shipth-is/cli)

**ShipThis** is a command-line tool for building and uploading your Godot mobile games to the Apple App Store and Google Play. It compiles your game on managed cloud servers. You do not need Xcode, Android Studio, or SDK installations. You can run it manually or from CI.

```bash
shipthis game ship
```

- **Always a free tier** - Enough build minutes for most solo devs
- **One-command setup** - Use the interactive [`wizard`](https://shipth.is/docs/reference/game/wizard) to configure your game
- **No additional tools** - No Xcode, Android Studio, or SDK installation required
- **Simplified provisioning** - We handle iOS certificates, Android keystores, app signing, and API keys
- **One-command deployment** - Publish to TestFlight or Google Play with a single command
